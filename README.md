# MDCS 1.5 Release Readme
_07/20/2018_

_This document describes the legacy MDCS 1.x (1.5 and former) releases._

* __Deprecation Notice__: The MDCS 1.5 (and former) releases are now officially deprecated and are no longer actively supported or maintained.

* __Access to Legacy 1.x Code__: If, on a case by case basis, individuals wish to request a tarball of the legacy MDCS 1.5 release, please email mdcs@list.nist.gov in order to obtain this.

* __Use of Latest Release__: We encourage users to use and work from the latest release, which is located at https://www.github.com/usnistgov/MDCS .

* __1.x Forks__: Any users who may have previously forked the 1.x repository at https://www.github.com/usnistgov/MDCS before 07/19/2018 will notice that the fork now points to another forked 1.x repository. This is to be expected based on Github's standard policy for transferring the status of the master repository to a particular fork when a public repository is deleted. The process is explained here: https://help.github.com/articles/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility/ .

* __1.x Local Repository Guidance__: For users who may currently have a local repository created from the 1.x MDCS repository prior to the 07/19/2018 deprecation, the following recommendations are provided:
  1. __PLEASE, DO NOT__ attempt to pull or to rebase a local (MDCS 1.x) repository (as this would result in trying to pull or rebase a MDCS 2.0 repository relative to a former MDCS 1.5 repository).

  2. __PLEASE, INSTEAD, DO__ create a new local repository, based on MDCS 2.0 going forward, located at https://www.github.com/usnistgov/MDCS .
